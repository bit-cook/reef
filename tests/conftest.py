"""Suite-wide fixtures: two plain loss families and a plain training objective.

Reef bundles no method-neutral objective, but many contracts want the
simplest possible family to drive the bridge, the runtime and the driver:
``sft`` (Slime's stock ``sft_loss``, advantages forbidden) and ``pg``
(Slime's stock ``policy_loss`` over one advantage per sample). They are
registered here as *external* families and the matching ``sft`` objective as
an external objective, through the same public extension points a cookbook
method would use, so every test that names them sees a registry shaped like
a deployment that brought its own plain objective.
