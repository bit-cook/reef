Choose a recipe for agent learning
==================================

Pick a recipe by the **task type** of your workload and by **what it
evolves**, model weights or the agent harness. Weight recipes need GPUs and
the training stack in `Train model weights from agent feedback
<evolve-your-model.rst>`__, while harness recipes need only a model endpoint.

Reefine ships with ``reef-infra``, and the other implementations live in the
repository's ``recipes/`` cookbook and do not ship in the Reef wheel.
``recipes/basic/`` is the record-only starting stack and stays outside the
catalog, and beta recipes join it once they publish learning results. The root
`README <../../README.md#-recipes-and-examples>`__ and `recipes/README.md
<../../recipes/README.md>`__ show the same catalog.

Scientific discovery
--------------------

One hard problem with a measurable objective, where the recipe makes repeated
attempts and trains on those attempts at test time.

Continual learning on a task stream
-----------------------------------

A stream of independent tasks that a verifier scores one by one, so the recipe
learns from each score before the next task arrives.

Learning from usage
-------------------

Real interaction where no one reports a score or the feedback arrives late, so
the recipe reads the signal out of the traffic it already serves.

How a recipe is selected
------------------------

A deployment serves exactly one recipe, named by ``recipe.implementation`` in its config.
Every scenario it creates uses that recipe. Requests never name a recipe, and
scenario snapshots do not store one. The scenario header is the only routing a
caller provides. The artifact repository is therefore deployment-owned: do not
point deployments configured with different recipes at the same repository.

.. code:: yaml

   schema-version: 2
   recipe:
     implementation: recipes.sao.recipe:SAORecipe
     config:
       batch-size: 1

``recipe.implementation`` accepts the core value ``recipe``, a dotted class, or a preset.
Reefine ships in Reef, and other learning methods are imported only when selected. The ``recipes/`` tree in
this repository is a cookbook; installed method packages work the same way.
`Configuration <../reference/configuration.rst#recipe-configuration>`__
describes each spelling.

Every recipe has a checkpoint strategy, defaulting to ``EveryNVersions(1)``.
``checkpoint_every_n_versions`` is the shorter spelling in deployment YAML.

Run the recipe you chose
------------------------

Start with the `inference and feedback quickstart
<../getting-started/quickstart.rst>`__ if you have not sent traffic through
Reef yet. For a harness recipe, follow `Evolve agent prompts, rules, and skills
<evolve-your-harness.rst>`__. For a weight recipe, follow `Train model weights
from agent feedback <evolve-your-model.rst>`__. Each recipe page above provides
its own configuration and example.

Built-in harness refinement
---------------------------

`Reefine <recipes/reefine.rst>`__ turns user instructions into harness updates
and ships with ``reef-infra``. Start it with ``reef serve --recipe reefine``
and a configured model endpoint.

Beta recipes
------------

`CORAL TTT <../../recipes/beta/coral/README.md>`__ and its
`coral_demo <../../recipes/beta/coral/examples/coral_demo/>`__ example are
**beta** until complete, reproducible learning results are published. Both
live under ``recipes/beta/coral/``. Integration and smoke tests validate the
wiring but do not establish learning performance.

`SPADE <../../recipes/beta/spade/README.md>`__ (self play in adaptive
synthetic executable environments, `arXiv:2608.19197
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.19197>`__) is **beta** under
``recipes/beta/spade/``: one policy plays an Environment Designer that writes
executable environments and a Reasoning Agent that learns in them. Reef knows
one task format, Harbor, and the Designer writes it directly: an instruction,
a container, a verifier and a reference solution, a task any Harbor agent can
play. Writing, checking and playing those tasks is Reef's
(``reef.record2dataset``, the generator service ``reef serve`` starts beside
the HTTP service); the package holds the method: the Designer's adversarial
experience section, the two arms each task is played with, the hint based
regret reported against the Designer's receipt, and the Reasoning Agent's
group relative training on the plain arm's episodes, all driven from its
processor. The Designer's own training follows.
