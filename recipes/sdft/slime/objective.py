"""SDFT's worker hooks: the backend's distillation loss and teacher pass under this family's names.

Slime's Megatron workers resolve the hooks by path; the base's
``reef.train.slime_backend.distill.objective`` does the work, and these entry
points exist so the family's hooks carry its name, as the loss-family
contract asks. Torch is imported only when a hook runs.
